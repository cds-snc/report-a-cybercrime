You might want to display some information to help the user, but that is not part of the main content.

# Wells

A well is used to display tips, information or content about the content. The well separates its content from the main content. Before you add a well, you should ask yourself if its content belongs to the main content of the page. If it does, do not use a well. Remember to keep the page content as simple as possible.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Well">
    <Well>This content is displayed in a well</Well>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Variants

<Preview>
  <Story name="Well Variants">
    <Well variantColor="yellow">
      This content is displayed in a yellow well
    </Well>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Composition

You can compose anything in a well, but remember to keep it simple

**Do**: Place a link in a Well

<Preview>
  <Story name="Well Composition Simple">
    <Well variantColor="yellow">
      This content is displayed in a <A href="#">yellow well</A>
    </Well>
  </Story>
</Preview>

**Be careful**: Compose with headings, compose with main interactables like buttons. To set something complex appart, use containers to create a card.

> **Rule of thumb**
>
> - A Well substract information from the main content.
> - A card adds a call to action

<Preview>
  <Story name="Well Composition Complex">
    <Well variantColor="green">
      <H2 mb={4}>Large heading</H2>
      <P>
        With a paragraph down here. You can compose anything in a well. Remember
        to keep things simple
      </P>
      <Button>Click here</Button>
    </Well>

# Alerts

An alert requires one of four statuses: `success`, `info`, `warning`, or `error`

An Alert should only be used to notify a user of a change on the current page or to notify the user about a change in the status of the app. For example: form submission, max uploaded files

An alert should only contain text

> Form errors are more complex and require the `<ErrorSummary/>` componnet

<Preview>
  <Story name="Alert">
    <Alert status="success" withIcon>
      This is an alert
    </Alert>
  </Story>
</Preview>

You can choose not to display an icon by omitting the `withIcon` prop

<Preview>
  <Story name="Alert No icon">
    <Alert status="info">This is an alert without an icon</Alert>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Props

<Props of={Alert} />
