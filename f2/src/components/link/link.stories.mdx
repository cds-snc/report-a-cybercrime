# Links

There are different ways to create links in the app. The one you chose depends on what you need.

## Routed links

Routed links are links that are using the react-router-dom library. They require a `to` property. Use Link to create navigation links between pages of the app

  <Story name="Link">
    <Link to="/path">Link</Link>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Props

<Props of={Link} />

## Anchors

Anchors are simple `<a>` tags. You'll need to pass an href to make sure they are valid.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Anchor">
    <P>
      <A href="http://canada.ca">Anchors</A> do not interrupt the flow of the
      content. Perfect for placing links in paragraphs
    </P>
  </Story>

### Props

<Props of={A} />

## Buttons that look like links

LinkButton does not require an `href` property because it is used to pass in an onclick event. If you can pass an href, do not use this variant.

<Preview>
  <Story name="LinkButton">
    <LinkButton onclick={(e) => e.preventDefault()}>
      A link that acts like a button
    </LinkButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Props

<Props of={LinkButton} />

## Links that look like buttons

ButtonLink looks like a button, but renders an `<a>` tag with a role property of button. Screen readers will read it as a button.

<Preview>
  <Story name="ButtonLink">
    <ButtonLink>A link that looks like a button</ButtonLink>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Props

<Props of={ButtonLink} />
