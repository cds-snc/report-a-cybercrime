# Getting started

This documentation is meant to help build and modify pages and forms.

---

# Reading Stories

You can access any documented component from the sidebar. Storybook is consisted of multiple `Stories`, which each correspond to a component or one of its variations.

Each Story also lets you view a code preview showing how to use the component in code. You can copy it from there as well as a properties table when applicable. Shows property name, possible values and types, and default values when applicable.

## Component variations

If a component is missing, it has not been documented. You can create a Github issue to request that someone document the missing component, or you can create the documentation in your own branch.

## Component views

Each component proposes two alternate views: Canvas or Docs. These are accessible from the top navigation bar.

The Canvas view lets you view a component on its own. This view also gives access to the addons panel at the bottom of the page.

The Docs view provides more context for a component. It can be automagically generated or written in MDX (Markdown + JSX)

# Writing Stories

Stories should be written in [Component Story Format (CSF)](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/). CSF Can be written in JSX. Stories written in JSX will automagically generate a Docs page.

## MDX

To start with MDX stories, you need a few basic imports.

```jsx
import { Meta, Story, Preview } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'
import ThemeDecorator from '../../../.storybook/themeDecorator'
```

Then add a Meta tag containing the title of your story. This title will display in the sidebar. add a decorator property to wrap your component in the `<ThemeProvider>`. If you forget this step, you'll likely end up with funky looking stories.

```jsx
<Meta title="Title of your story" decorators={[ThemeDecorator]} />
```

Then you can write your story by alternating between Markdown syntax and JSX syntax. To add a component block, just use `<Preview>` and `<Story>`. Every story should have a unique name.

```jsx
//With a code block
<Preview>
  <Story name="Story">
    <Component/>
  </Story>
</Preview>

//Without a code block
<Story name="Another Story">
  <Component/>
</Story>
```

## JS

Writing stories in JSX is very similar. You start with different imports.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ThemeDecorator from '../../../.storybook/themeDecorator'
```

Then you need to export a story. This is similar to the MDX `<Meta>` element

```jsx
export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  decorators: [ThemeDecorator],
}
```

For each component variation, you want to export a unique story

```jsx
export const story = () => <Component />
```
